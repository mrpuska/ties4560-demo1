  <p>Here is a model presentation of an application for viewing restaurants and representing their lunch menus.</p>
  <p>The application is supposed to have a web ui frontend, which is not presented here.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The application is fairly simple, building mainly from a REST api, data access layer and an integration service
    for fetching the restaurant information and all of the lunch menus. On the right side, simple use cases for the 
    user and an administrator user can be found.</p>
